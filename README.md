# conference-app

Here will be some information about the app.

## How to start?

Start simple by running `yarn watch` (or `npm run watch`, if you set up the project with `npm`). This will start the project with a local development server.

The source files are located in the [`src`](./src) folder. All web components are within the [`src/client/modules`](./src/modules) folder. The folder hierarchy also represents the naming structure of the web components. The entry file for the custom Express configuration can be found in the ['src/server'](./src/server) folder.

### Notes 
cd conference-app
npm run watch (or yarn watch if you selected yarn when the CLI prompted you for a package manager).
Note
Note
The watch process automatically keeps track of your code changes, recompiles and refreshes the application in the browser. You donâ€™t need to compile your changes manually and reload the application in the browser.

In a browser window, navigate to http://0.0.0.0:3001 for Mac or http://localhost:3001 for Windows to access the default application.
